          # handles exceptions which don't bubble up so that Sequel
          # can retry transactions with the :retry_on option when there's
          # a deadlock.
          #
          # This is exacerbated by the fact that changesets insert multiple
          # tuples with individual INSERT statements because ROM specifies
          # to Sequel to return a list of primary keys created. The likelihood
          # of a deadlock is reduced with batched INSERT statements.
          #
          # For this reason we need to manually insert changeset records to avoid
          # MySQL deadlocks or to allow Sequel to retry transactions
          # when the :retry_on option is specified.
