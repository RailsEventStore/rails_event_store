We're aiming for 100% mutation coverage in this project.
Read the reasoning:

[Why I want to introduce mutation testing to the rails_event_store gem](http://blog.arkency.com/2015/04/why-i-want-to-introduce-mutation-testing-to-the-rails-event-store-gem/)

[Mutation testing and continuous integration](http://blog.arkency.com/2015/05/mutation-testing-and-continuous-integration/)

In practice, it means that we run `make mutate` as part of the CI process.
Whenever you fix a bug or add a new feature, we require that the coverage doesn't go down.
