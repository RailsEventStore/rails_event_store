title: Logging request metadata
---

In Rails environment, every event is enhanced with the request metadata provided by `rack` server as long as you configure your event store instance in `config.event_store`. This can help with debugging and building an audit log from events for the future use.

## Setup

In order to enhance your events with metadata, you need to setup your client as described in [Installation](/docs/install).

## Defaults

With default configuration metadata is enhanced by:

- `:remote_ip` - IP of the HTTP client which issued the request.
- `:request_id` - An unique ID of the request.

This metadata is included **only for published events**. So creating a new event instance by hand won't add metadata to it:

```ruby
event = MyEvent.new(event_data)
event.metadata # empty, unless you provided your own data called 'metadata'.
```

If you publish an event, the special field called `metadata` will get filled in with request details:

```ruby
event_store.publish(MyEvent.new(data: {foo: 'bar'}))

my_event = event_store.read.last
my_event.metadata[:remote_ip] # your IP
my_event.metadata[:request_id] # unique ID
```

## Configuration

You can configure which metadata you'd like to catch. To do so, you need to provide a `lambda` which takes Rack environment and returns a metadata hash/object.

This can be configurable when instantinating the `RailsEventStore::Client` instance with `request_metadata` option.

Here is an example of such configuration (in `config/application.rb`), replicating the default behaviour:

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../boot', __FILE__)

require "rails"
# Pick the frameworks you want:
require "active_model/railtie"
require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "action_view/railtie"
require "rails/test_unit/railtie"

Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module YourAppName
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.event_store = RailsEventStore::Client.new(
      request_metadata: -> (env) do
        request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)
        { remote_ip:  request.remote_ip,
          request_id: request.uuid,
        }
      end
    )

    # ...
  end
end
```

You can read more about your possible options by reading [ActionDispatch::Request](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html) documentation.

## Passing your own metadata using with_metadata

Apart from using the middleware, you can also set your metadata with `RubyEventStore::Client#with_metadata` method. You can specify custom metadata that will be added to all events published inside a block:

```ruby
event_store.with_metadata(remote_ip: '1.2.3.4', request_id: SecureRandom.uuid) do
  event_store.publish(MyEvent.new(data: {foo: 'bar'}))
end

my_event = event_store.read.last

my_event.metadata[:remote_ip] #=> '1.2.3.4'
my_event.metadata[:request_id] #=> unique ID
```

When using `with_metadata`, the `timestamp` is still added to the metadata unless you explicitly specify it on your own. Additionally, if you are nesting `with_metadata` blocks or also using the middleware & `request_metadata` lambda, your metadata passed as `with_metadata` argument will be merged with the result of `rails_event_store.request_metadata` proc:

```ruby
event_store.with_metadata(causation_id: 1234567890) do
  event_store.with_metadata(correlation_id: 987654321) do
    event_store.publish(MyEvent.new(data: {foo: 'bar'}))
  end
end

my_event = event_store.read.last
my_event.metadata[:remote_ip]      #=> your IP from request metadata proc
my_event.metadata[:request_id]     #=> unique ID from request metadata proc
my_event.metadata[:causation_id]   #=> 1234567890 from with_metadata argument
my_event.metadata[:correlation_id] #=> 987654321 from with_metadata argument
my_event.metadata[:timestamp]      #=> a timestamp
```

### Recording current user in request–response cycle

One can use metadata to associate a logged-in user with domain events published in a request-response cycle of a web application. This is useful for auditing purpose.

Consider following Rails `ApplicationController` with a method returning currently logged-in user or `nil`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  def current_user
    # ...
  end
end
```

We can use `with_metadata` combined with an `around_action` to wrap an action handling incoming request. Every domain event that originated from a controller action would get `user_id` key in its metadata with the value taken from `current_user.id` or being `nil`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  around_action :use_request_metadata

  private

  def use_request_metadata(&block)
    Rails.configuration.event_store.with_metadata(request_metadata, &block)
  end

  def request_metadata
    { user_id: current_user&.id }
  end
end
```

This metadata would be added to domain events published in synchronous handlers as well, as they happen immediately in the same request-response cycle.

### Passing metadata to asynchronous handlers

Asynchronous event handling by design happens outside of the request-response cycle — in a different thread or completely different process. Our only source of metadata is the event we're processing in a handler.

Let's look at an example how to retain it's metadata in any domain event published in an asynchronous handler.

```ruby
OrderPlaced = Class.new(RailsEventStore::Event)

module MetadataHandler
  def perform(event)
    event_store.with_metadata(**event.metadata.to_h) do
      super
    end
  end

  def event_store
    Rails.configuration.event_store
  end
end

class OrderHandler < ActiveJob::Base
  prepend RubyEventStore::AsyncHandler
  prepend MetadataHandler

  def perform(event)
    # ...
  end
end

event_store = RailsEventStore::Client.new
event_store.subscribe(OrderHandler, to: [OrderPlaced])
```

In `MetadataHandler` we first read existing metadata from the currently processed event and then decorate any further event publications inside the handler with that metadata.
