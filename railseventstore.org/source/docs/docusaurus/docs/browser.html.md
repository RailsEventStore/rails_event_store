Browser is a web interface that allows you to inspect existing streams and their contents. You can use it for debugging purpose as well as a built-in audit log frontend.

## Adding browser to the project

### Rails

Browser is now an integral part of RailsEventStore bundle and comes as a dependency when you install `rails_event_store` gem. To enable it in your Rails project, add following line to `routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw { mount RailsEventStore::Browser => "/res" if Rails.env.development? }
```

It is assumed that you have Rails Event Store configured at `Rails.configuration.event_store`, in [recommended](https://railseventstore.org/docs/v2/install/) location.

The `RailsEventStore::Browser` is just a wrapper around `RubyEventStore::Browser::App` with default options suitable for most applications. Read below the [Rack](#sinatra-rack), in case you need this browser outside as a standalone application or you have a different event store location.

### Rack

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "ruby_event_store-browser"
```

Add this to your `config.ru` or wherever you mount your Rack apps to enable web interface. Check the appropriate environment variable (e.g. `ENV['RACK_ENV']`) to only mount the browser in the appropriate environment such as `development`.

There is a helper method on the Rack app to configure options `event_store_locator`, `host` and `path`.

```ruby
# e.g. config.ru

require "ruby_event_store/browser/app"

# Example RES client you might configure
event_store = RubyEventStore::Client.new(repository: RubyEventStore::InMemoryRepository.new)

run RubyEventStore::Browser::App.for(event_store_locator: -> { event_store })
```

## Usage in production

### Rails

In a production environment you'll likely want to protect access to the browser. You can use the constraints feature of routing (in the `config/routes.rb` file) to accomplish this:

#### Devise

Allow any authenticated `User`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  authenticate :user do
    mount RailsEventStore::Browser => "/res"
  end
end
```

Allow any authenticated `User` for whom `User#admin?` returns `true`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  authenticate :user, lambda { |u| u.admin? } do
    mount RailsEventStore::Browser => "/res"
  end
end
```

### HTTP Basic Auth

Use HTTP Basic Auth with credentials set from `RES_BROWSER_USERNAME` and `RES_BROWSER_PASSWORD` environment variables:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  browser =
    Rack::Builder.new do
      use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|
        # Protect against timing attacks:
        # - See https://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/
        # - See https://thisdata.com/blog/timing-attacks-against-string-comparison/
        # - Use & (do not use &&) so that it doesn't short circuit.
        # - Use digests to stop length information leaking (see also ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.variable_size_secure_compare)
        ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(
          ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(username),
          ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(ENV["RES_BROWSER_USERNAME"]),
        ) &
          ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(
            ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(password),
            ::Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(ENV["RES_BROWSER_PASSWORD"]),
          )
      end

      map "/" do
        run RailsEventStore::Browser
      end
    end

  mount browser => "/res"
end
```

### Related Streams

Often you have streams, which are closely related to each other. To ease debugging, you may want to create custom links between streams. For example, if you are viewing stream `Ordering::Order$123`, you may want to link to stream `Payments::Transaction$456`.

You can do that by passing related streams query object to browser configuration. Related streams query object can be anything, which reponds to `call(stream_name)` and always return an array (i.e. it can be simple lambda).

Related streams will be displayed in stream view, at the bottom.

Example usage:

```ruby
class RelatedStreamsQuery
  def call(stream_name)
    prefix, suffix = stream_name.split("$")
    if prefix == "Ordering::Order"
      transaction_id = # some way to fetch transaction id for that order
        return ["Payments::Transaction$#{transaction_id}"]
    end
    return []
  end
end

RubyEventStore::Browser::App.for(related_streams_query: RelatedStreamsQuery.new)
```
