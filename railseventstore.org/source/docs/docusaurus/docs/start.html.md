- decide if default `YAML` serialization suits your needs, see more about serialization formats [here](/docs/v2/mapping_serialization)

- implement your aggregates using `AggregateRoot` module, see how [here](/docs/v2/app)
- subscribe to domain events published, [check how](/docs/v2/subscribe) to define subscriptions and event handlers
- learn Command pattern and [how to](/docs/v2/command_bus) use Arkency's command bus to decouple your domain model from controllers
- check [how to](/docs/v2/rspec) use provied `RSpec` matchers
- learn more about:
  - [reading](/docs/v2/read) domain events
  - [publishing](/docs/v2/publish) domain events
  - logging [request metadata](/docs/v2/request_metadata)
  - concurrencycontrol using [expected version](/docs/v2/expected_version)
