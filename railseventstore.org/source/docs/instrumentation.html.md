title: Instrumentation
---

RubyEventStore and RailsEventStore ships with built-in instrumentation on which you can build additional features or benchmark event store performance in your app.

## Enabling instrumentation

#### RailsEventStore

RailsEventStore is integrated with `ActiveSupport::Notifications` by default. You don't have to do anything else.

#### RubyEventStore

Instrumentation is provided by `InstrumentedRepository` and `InstrumentedDispatcher` decorators. We don't force any particular instrumentation framework, [as long as it has the same API](https://github.com/bernd/as-notifications) as `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.

That having said, if you want to instrument your event store with `ActiveSupport::Notifications`, initialize your client with following repository and/or dispatcher:

```ruby
repository = RailsEventStoreActiveRecord::EventRepository.new # or other repo you use
dispatcher = RubyEventStore::Dispatcher.new # or other dispatcher you use
RubyEventStore::Client.new(
  repository: InstrumentedRepository.new(repository, ActiveSupport::Notifications),
  dispatcher: InstrumentedDispatcher.new(dispatcher, ActiveSupport::Notifications)
)
```

## Usage

Subscribe to the hooks as [Rails guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#subscribing-to-an-event) and [manual](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html) recommend.

#### Example

```ruby
name = "append_to_stream.repository.rails_event_store"
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(name) do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
  metric = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(name, start, finish, id, payload)
  NewRelic::Agent.record_metric('Custom/RES/append_to_stream', metric.duration)
end
```
