* implement your aggregates using `AggregateRoot` module, see how [here](/docs/v1/app)
* subscribe to domain events published, [check how](/docs/v1/subscribe) to define subscriptions and event handlers
* learn Command pattern and [how to](/docs/v1/command_bus) use Arkency's command bus to decouple your domain model from controllers
* check [how to](/docs/v1/rspec) use provied `RSpec` matchers

  * [reading](/docs/v1/read) domain events
  * [publishing](/docs/v1/publish) domain events
  * logging [request metadata](/docs/v1/request_metadata)
