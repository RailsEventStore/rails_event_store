# Building an event sourced application with RailsEventStore gem

AggregateRoot module & AggregateRepository have been extracted from RailsEventStore to separate gem.
See [aggregate_root](https://github.com/arkency/aggregate_root) gem readme to find help how to start.
Also [this example](https://github.com/mpraglowski/cqrs-es-sample-with-res) might be useful.
